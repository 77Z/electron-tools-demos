# Docs
This section is the documentation for Electron Tools

To get started, you're gonna need the package. To get it, you need NPM. If you're looking at this page, we expect that you're somewhat expirenced with Electron.

## Install

To install Electron Tools type `npm i electron-tools` into your terminal.

If Electron isn't already installed in your project, NPM will install it for you before installing Electron Tools.

Electron Tools is currently only being tested in the renderer process.

## Setup

To get Electron Tools setup in your project, like any other Node Module, all you have to do is require it in the renderer process.
```javascript
const et = require("electron-tools");
```

That's all there is to getting it in your project.

## Functions and calling them

As of writing this, electron tools is on version 2.0.0. So some things may change.

To call a function you must use that name of the constant you used earlier. We used `et`.

Use that name and then .whatEverFunction();

Example:
```javascript
et.openLink("https://github.com/77Z/electron-tools");
```

Functions:
